Ansible playbook to set up OSX environment.

##### To run:

1. Install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) manually (easiest install)
2. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
3. `brew install python` (it's better than system python, see guide)
4. `pip install ansible` (better than homebrew package as it's always latest)
5. Run `ansible-playbook playbook.yml`
